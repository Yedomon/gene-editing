> Nevertheless, to further understand the underlying genetic mechanism of phenotypic variation during sorghum domestication and improvement, more reference genomes are needed, which may provide opportunities for sorghum genomic research and molecular breeding.

> Understanding the genetic basis of speciation and agroclimatic adaption of sorghum could facilitate molecular breeding and provide valuable information for other crops as well. The naturally diverse resources available for sorghum, including the genetic (grain, forage, sweet and biofuel types) and geographical resources, provide rich materials for population genomic research.

> Genetic diversity is an important basis for genetic dissection of complex traits and sorghum breeding, and population structure is crucial for understanding the historical population dynamic, such as population size, geographical population change and genetic differentiation.
